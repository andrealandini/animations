# Animation Directory

This directory serves as the central repository for all my animations. It not only houses the animations I'm currently working on but also acts as the storage space for animations relevant to various projects. Any animations pertinent to other ongoing or future projects will be uploaded and maintained here.

### Purpose

The primary objective of this directory is to streamline the organization and accessibility of animations. By centralizing all animation work in one location, it becomes easier to manage, access, and share these assets across different projects. This approach ensures a more efficient workflow, allowing for quick access to relevant animations for different project requirements.

### Usage

1. **Current Projects**: All animations being actively worked on will be stored here for easy access and management.
2. **Cross-Project Assets**: Any animations relevant to multiple projects or shared among different endeavors will also be uploaded and maintained within this directory.

This directory serves as a comprehensive collection of animations, fostering a more organized and accessible approach to handling animation assets for various projects.

Feel free to contribute, upload, and manage animations in this directory to support a seamless workflow across different projects.
